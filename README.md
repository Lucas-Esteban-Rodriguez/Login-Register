Welcome to my project, which tries to demonstrate my knowledge in various tools, always trying to learn new and efficient things.
My project consist of a part of a web page typically where there is usually a Login/Register.
Used tools:

  -React.js:
  This is based on React.js, where I can demonstrate my handling of this javascript framework, with this I can demonstrate that I can use and learn React.
  Things I've used from React:
  
  *Its components, at all times thinking about their scalability and simplicity.
  
  *Hooks, taking advantage of hooks, useState() for handling state changes in information and the DOM, useContext() and createContext() both for transporting information   from end to end between components.
  
  *Implement the React-Router-DOM library to achieve manipulation of web routes using the useNavigate() hook.
  
  *Native Javascript for the use of logic both in information and in DOM management.
  
  -HTML: Good use of HTML, where i can create a functionally and simple design.
  
  -CSS: Here I try to show that I am capable of achieving anything in CSS just by researching and writing code, creating custom styles and always using tools that allow    for better design, like the Coolors page where it provides colors or GenerateBackground.
  
  -Bootstrap: I know bootstrap and I know that I can know more, as well as other frameworks, bootstrap to be more efficient.
  
  -Firebase: A database for management of information.
  
 
Thank you for viewing my project, I hope to be better in the next one, I accept any criticism and suggestion to improve this project, rodriguezlucasesteban24@gmail.com.
